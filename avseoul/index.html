I am a computer graphics artist and creative developer from Seoul, Korea.</p> <p>I love things that are raw, bold, and rough but that are not indigested or distracted. I also love things that are sophisticated, elaborated, and refined but that are not boring or indistinctive.</p> </div> <div class="contentDescription"> <p>As a MTV kid from the 90's, I love music videos. Iâ€™ve grown up watching those music videos from the golden era of MTVâ€™s. Chris Cunningham, Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Hype Williams, and so on, these names still excite me.</p> <p>I majored in digital media design at Hong-ik University in Korea, although I spent most of my time in a film studio for a film major in the same college. I made a couple music videos for underground musicians when I was a poor university kid so I needed to find a way to make things look cooler with limited resources.</p> <p>Some of the things that I learned from these days are still a huge part of my artistic style, such as fast cross cut editing style or extreme close up framing or highly noised and thresholded coloring things like that. These were the outcome from mostly trying to hide clumsiness from low budget production.</p> <p>I also learned compositing and 3D CGI from the same reason as well. CGI style music video was huge back in the late 1990â€™s and early 2000â€™s and a good way to compensate for poor quality footage.</p> <p>With these experiences in production and post production, I started expanding my body of work into a variety of directions that range from 3D projection mappings, experimental films, motion graphics, 3D animations, commercial films, and more. I've been collaborating with brands and companies, creating artworks mostly in 3D projection mappings and art films.</p> </div> <div class="contentDescription"> <p>In 2014, I moved to New York. I studied creative codings, specifically regards to real time 3D computer graphics and shaders to create visual FX, for my master's degree at Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) in New York University. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working as a creative developer whoâ€™s specialized in real time CGI and visual FX, animation, and interaction design. </p> <p>I was a creative developer at <a href="https://fakelove.tv/" target="_blank">FakeLove</a> from 2016 to 2018, I mainly developed and designed real time visual FX for various platforms such as digital installations, mobile apps, AR content with various frameworks such as Cinder, OpenFrameworks, Threejs, TouchDesigners, and Unity3D.</p> <p>Currently, Iâ€™m a creative developer at <a href="https://spatial.io/" target="_blank">Spatial</a> since 2018. My role is mainly in designing and implementing performant VFX, animations, and front end features for various platforms including VR/AR, such as Microsoft Hololens1, Hololens2, Oculus Quest1, Quest2, iOS, android, and web browser with Unity and Three.js.</p> </div> <div class="contentDescription"> <p>Iâ€™m still a music video enthusiast. Although I donâ€™t do filming anymore (although Iâ€™d still love to whenever I get a chance) but now I make real time audio reactive artworks instead. Not many demos are available at this moment since I have turned down and closed most of my previous works and am planning to update them but things are going slow. But in the meantime, please enjoy playing with a few webgl demos and watching my old works recorded in videos. Hope you find something interesting. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="listContainer"> <div id="link"> <span><a href="https://www.twitter.com/avseoul/" target="_blank">Twitter</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/avseoul/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avseoul/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></span> </div> </div> </div> <div id="webgl" class="container"> <div> <h1>WebGL Demos</h1> </div> <div class="listContainer" name="FUZZY_BLOB" url="https://avseoul.net/FUZZY_BLOB/"> <div class="listThumbnailImageContainer"> <iframe id="iframe_FUZZY_BLOB" src=""></iframe> </div> <div class="listDescription"> <rainbow> <p><a href="https://avseoul.net/FUZZY_BLOB/" target="_blank">FUZZY BLOB - realtime audio reactivesketch</a></p> </rainbow> </div> </div> <div class="listContainer" name="BAD_SIGNALS" url="https://avseoul.net/BAD_SIGNALS/"> <div class="listThumbnailImageContainer"> <iframe id="iframe_BAD_SIGNALS" src=""></iframe> </div> <div class="listDescription"> <rainbow> <p><a href="https://avseoul.net/BAD_SIGNALS/" target="_blank">BAD SIGNALS - realtime audio reactive sketch</a></p> </rainbow> </div> </div> <div class="listContainer" name="particleEqualizer" url="https://avseoul.net/particleEqualizer/"> <div class="listThumbnailImageContainer"> <iframe id="iframe_particleEqualizer" src=""></iframe> </div> <div class="listDescription"> <rainbow> <p><a href="https://avseoul.net/particleEqualizer/" target="_blank">particle equalizer - realtime audio reactive sketch</a> ðŸ‘ˆ got featured on <a class="is_fucked" href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/webgl-particle-audio-visualizer" target="_blank">Chrome Experiment</a> by Google</p> </rainbow> </div> </div> </div> <div id="selectedWorks" class="container"> <div> <h1>Selected Works</h1> </div> </div> <div id="caseStudies" class="container"> <div> <h1>Case Studies</h1> </div> </div> </body></html></html>
